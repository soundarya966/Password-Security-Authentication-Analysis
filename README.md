# Task 4: Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## Objective
To understand how passwords are stored securely, analyze password attacks, and study authentication mechanisms.

## Tools Used
- Hashcat
- John the Ripper
- Online Hash Generators

## Steps Followed
1. Studied password hashing and encryption
2. Generated password hashes
3. Identified hash types
4. Performed dictionary and brute force attacks on weak hashes
5. Analyzed why weak passwords fail
6. Studied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
7. Documented security recommendations

## Key Learnings
- Hashing is one-way and secure
- Weak passwords are easy to crack
- MFA adds an essential security layer
- bcrypt is preferred for password storage

## Outcome
Improved understanding of password security, attacks, and defenses.
